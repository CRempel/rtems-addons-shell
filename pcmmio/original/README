This is a port of the Winsystems Linux driver to RTEMS.

In general, the goal was to minimize changes to the user level
library and only replace Linux IO calls to the device driver
with direct access functions. 

The driver uses 4 Classic API Barriers.

Issues
======
+ The library is not reentrant. The GNU/Linux version uses global variables
  to track the state of certain variables and access to these is not protected.
  This design flaw is carried over into the RTEMS version.

+ We want to timestamp samples and the current code does not do that.

+ Need an RTEMS configuration.
